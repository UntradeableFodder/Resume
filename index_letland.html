<h1>The Letland Story</h1>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Okay, so I thought I would just briefly explain the story about why my lastname is Letland/Latvia. <br> 
    To be honest, I more or less just wanted to practice linking to another webpage. 
</p>
<h4>The story unfolded</h4>
<p>Are you excited? Maybe not. Anyhow. Let's do this. 
    <ol>
        <li>Around Summer 2021 I hang out with some friends and somehow we discussed funny last names. </li>
        <li>After some good laughs we ended with Mads Latvia and thought it sounded pretty funny. It just felt good basicially</li>
        <li>A few days later I had a look at if it was possible to change my last name according <i>The Danish Agency of Family Law</i>.</li>
        <li>At their website different rules were listed. The last one stated something like "(...) <i>if it's not suitable you cannot change your last name</i>", and my hopes were lost for what had actually become something I really wanted</li>
        <li>I applied for the cost of 100 dollar</li>
        <li>Exptected processing time was up to 9 months and almost 9 months later I finally recieved my reply</li>
        <li>... Aaaand it was approved! </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h4>But why change it? ... you may ask</h4>
<p>Just for fun. <br> It's just a name at the end of the day.</p>
