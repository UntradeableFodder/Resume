<h4>My story in short</h4>
<p>Recently, I decided to go in a whole new direction in terms of what I want to work with in future.</p>
<p>As of 16th August 2023, after intensive consideration I decided that I want to become a full stack developer. </p>
<p>Yes, it took a long time to figure out so to say. But this is it. No looking back. No regrets. I firmly believe this suits my personality and what I want to achieve in life.</p>
<p>Therefore I am currently following an online course at Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu. This resume is the end of the html course section, before I move on to CSS and eventually JS.</p>
